# Demarcation

## What React _is not_

React _is not_...

* an architecture (like MVC)
* a web framework (like Ember.js)

## What React _is_

React _is_...

* a **view library**

. . .

that implements

* a **virtual DOM**
* a **DOM diffing** and **patching** algorithm

# Simplicity

## Cognitive Load

> [...] we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost
to **shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic
process**, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text
space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible. 

--- E.W. Dijkstra (1968) "A Case against the GO TO Statement"

\note[item]{Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.}
